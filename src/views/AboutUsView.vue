        <p>
          Fellowship Church Streetsvile was started in 2014 when a group of men and women got
          together who all had a shared vision of planting churches in the GTA. We are a church who
          believes in servant leadership from all members and our desire is to make the members
          successful at what they are doing. Our church is non-denominational in flavour, with high
          values in family, wisdom, friendship and love. We believe our greatest calling is to
          develop a deep and meaningful relationship with God and to understand Him in His fullness.

          We are an open and honest church. We encourage questions. Curious on what to wear? Wear
          whatever you are comfortable in. We are more interested in you rather than what you wear.
          If you have a curious mind, come check us out. Pastors are available after church and if
          you would like to meet with a pastor outside of church, you can click here to
