        <p>
          We started in 2014 when a group of men and women got together who all had a shared vision
          of planting churches in the GTA. We are a church who believes in servant leadership from
          all members and our desire is to make the members successful at what they are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our church is non-denominational in flavour, with high values in family, wisdom,
          friendship and love. We believe our greatest calling is to develop a deep and meaningful
          relationship with God and to understand Him in His fullness.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are an open and honest church. We encourage questions. Curious on what to wear? Wear
          whatever you are comfortable in. We are more interested in you rather than what you wear.
        </p>

        <h2>Jamey Baird</h2>
        <h3>Pastor</h3>
        <p>
          Jamey Baird is a graduate of Ontario Bible College and of Tyndale Theological Seminary. He
          has been working with church planting and has done youth work for over 30 years within the
          GTA. Jamey is married to his lovely wife Sonja, who is also involved in church planting
          and youth work, and they are currently living in Milton. Jamey is bi-vocational, is on the
          chaplain staff at Sheridan Villa Long Term Care facility and works with Solid Rock Chapel
          in Clarkson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jamey loves nothing more than to answer your questions about Jesus. He understands that
          sometimes we can get caught up with misinformation about who Jesus was, what the church is
          or what the Bible says. He wants to help others understand more about Christ. Jamey would
          love to meet you at a coffee shop, for lunch after church, or even in your home to answer
          all your questions and give a clear presentation of all that Jesus came to do for us.
