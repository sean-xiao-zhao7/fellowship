      <h1>About Fellowship Church Streetsville</h1>
      <div class="about-paragraphs">
        <p>
          We started in 2014 when a group of men and women got together who all had a shared vision
          of planting churches in the GTA. We are a church who believes in servant leadership from
          all members and our desire is to make the members successful at what they are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our church is non-denominational in flavour, with high values in family, wisdom,
          friendship and love. We believe our greatest calling is to develop a deep and meaningful
          relationship with God and to understand Him in His fullness.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are an open and honest church. We encourage questions. Curious on what to wear? Wear
          whatever you are comfortable in. We are more interested in you rather than what you wear.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Jamey Baird</h2>
        <h3>Pastor</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/aboutus/jamey.png" class="portrait" />
        <p>
          Jamey Baird is a graduate of Ontario Bible College and of Tyndale Theological Seminary. He
          has been working with church planting and has done youth work for over 30 years within the
          GTA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jamey is married to his lovely wife Sonja, who is also involved in church planting and
          youth work, and they are currently living in Milton. Jamey is bi-vocational, is on the
          chaplain staff at Sheridan Villa Long Term Care facility and works with Solid Rock Chapel
          in Clarkson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jamey loves nothing more than to answer your questions about Jesus. He understands that
          sometimes we can get caught up with misinformation about who Jesus was, what the church is
          or what the Bible says.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wants to help others understand more about Christ. Jamey would love to meet you at a
          coffee shop, for lunch after church, or even in your home to answer all your questions and
          give a clear presentation of all that Jesus came to do for us.

        <h2>David Trenado</h2>
        <h3>Pastor</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/aboutus/david1.png" class="portrait" />
        <p>
          David grew up in Arganda del Rey, Madrid in Spain. From the beginning of his life he knew
          that there was something in his inner that needed to be fulfilled. At the age of 12, he
          surrendered his life to Christ and got baptized. From adolescence and because of his
          parent’s example, David met the gospel in a very practical way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helping his parents in their ministry and being a witness of their love for people in
          social exclusion gave him a perfect match of what the gospel is, a perfect example of how
          to live sacrificially and seeking the good of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          David and his family came to Canada in April 2015, leaving everything behind and without
          knowing anyone in Canada, taking a step of faith and obedience. God was the connector
          between David’s family and Fellowship Church. Basketball is one of David’s passions and it
          was because of that, Fellowship Church and David’s family were connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          David is responsible for helping the congregation bring people to Christ, develop
          disciples and live lives of compassion, mercy, and justice. He preaches, teaches, works
          with leaders and tries to meet with people as much as possible. David has 2 children, Marcos and Sofia. Marcos loves basketball & Sofia loves arts and
          crafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          David is also serving as the National Director of Sport for FCA Canada, trying to connect the community with the local church through sports and the
          gospel. He is a basketball coach and you will find him practicing and teaching basketball
          very often.

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        2-Fold. We Preaching the Gospel and we share our Prevention Story. Proverbs 24:11 says,
        "Rescue those being led away to death and hold back those staggering toward slaughter."
        Rescuing speaks of salvation and holding back speaks of preventing people from making bad
        choices. Our mission is to preach with the purpose of saving souls.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        Our vision is to inspire people to trust God. Trust is the path a person travels to fulfill
        their unique purpose in the world. Trust is based on our understanding of God’s will and its
        fruits are enjoyed when we actually obey God in the real world.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Following Jesus and the teachings of the New Testament</h2>
      <p>
        Solid, biblical doctrine and adherence to the literal interpretation of Jesus’ life and
        message is at the core of everything we do. The central doctrines of salvation,
        sanctification, the Trinity, the infallible word of God, and grace by faith are the
        lifeblood that makes this church go.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Devotion</h2>
      <p>
        All of us are committed. The question is, are we giving our lives to what matters?
        Fellowship Church seeks to encourage people to align their priorities to those which are
        most important. Our behaviour, spiritual disciplines, use of time and money, all demonstrate
        what is most important to us. (Mt. 22:37-40)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>
        Exploring God is better in community. Life isn’t meant to be lived in isolation, but with
        others. (Heb 10:24,25)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Generosity</h2>
      <p>
        Life is not about you. When we give generously, we receive abundantly. This applies to the
        resources we have been given: our time, our possessions, our money, and our abilities. (Pr.
        11:25)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        The highest form of relationship is interdependence. Without mutual partnership, no one
        truly wins. Our hope is to create vibrant partnerships with people, organizations, and other
        churches that make a difference in the community. (Eccl 4:12,13)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Salvation</h2>
      <p>
        We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ: His death, burial, and resurrection.
        Salvation is a gift from God, not a result of our good works or of any human efforts
        (Ephesians 2:8-9; Galatians 2:16, 3:8; Titus 3:5; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31; Hebrews 9:22).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Repentance</h2>
      <p>
        Repentance is the commitment to turn away from sin in every area of our lives and to follow
        Christ, which allows us to receive His redemption and to be regenerated by the Holy Spirit.
        Thus, through repentance we receive forgiveness of sins and appropriate salvation (Acts
        2:21, 3:19; I John 1:9).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Sanctification</h2>
      <p>
        Sanctification is the ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word and His Spirit in order to
        complete the development of Christ’s character in us. It is through the present ministry of
        the Holy Spirit and the Word of God that the Christian is enabled to live a Godly life (I
        Thessalonians 4:3,5:23; II Corinthians 3:18, 6:14-18, II Thessalonians 2:1-3, Romans 8:29,
        12:1-2, Hebrews 2:11).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Movement</h2>
      <p>
        We want to do more than start church. We have a vision to start a movement through
        communicating the life transformation that happens when Christ is at the centre. In other
        words, we want to plant churches that plant churches. (Acts 2:42)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <h2>Jesus' Blood</h2>
      <p>
        The Blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was sinless and is 100% sufficient
        to cleanse mankind of all sin. Jesus allowed Himself to be punished for both our sinfulness
        and our sins, enabling all those who believe to be free from the penalty of sin, which is
        death (I John 1:7; Revelation 1:5, 5:9; Colossians 1:20; Romans 3:10-12, 23, 5:9; John
        1:29).
